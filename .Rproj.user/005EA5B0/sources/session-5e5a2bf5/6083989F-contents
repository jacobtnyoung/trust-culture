### ***Abstract***

Objectives: To examine participatory research (PR) in a women’s prison to assess: (1) whether incarcerated interviewers elicit different knowledge than outside interviewers and (2) whether incarcerated interviewers are perceived as more trustworthy than outside interviewers. Methods: We conducted a randomized experiment with 158 incarcerated women in Arizona, assigning participants to be interviewed by either an incarcerated (n=78) or outside (n=80) interviewer. Participants discussed their experiences of trust and relationships within the prison environment, as well as their comfort level with the assigned interviewer. Results: We observed few statistically significant differences between conditions. However, interviewer trustworthiness varied: participants assigned to incarcerated interviewers more often voiced concerns about confidentiality and information sharing. Conclusions: This study contributes to inclusive prison research approaches that engage incarcerated people as partners in the research process. However, using incarcerated interviewers raises ethical concerns, including risks related to perceived coercion and harm.

## Overview of Repository

### Folders

There are three folders:

  * *PR-interviewer-rodeo*-this folder contains the cleaned data and the files to render the analyses.
  
  * *PR-interviewer-wrangling*-this contains the raw data and the scripts to prepare the data for analysis (that is, the rodeo folder). Note that the raw data used in the analysis cannot be shared as they are restricted use.
  
  * *PR-interviewer-utils*-contains scripts for generating functions and other utilities.

Each folder contains a README file that describes the contents of the folder in more detail.
