### ***Abstract***

“Culture” is frequently invoked as an explanatory device in criminology and criminal justice. This is particularly true for the study of incarcerated women. Nearly a century of research has examined the “culture” of women’s prisons, emphasizing the salience of trust relationships in this setting for understanding social order. However, the preponderance of this work primarily documents the importance of trust, with less attention given to understanding the meanings incarcerated attribute to trust relationships. This study draws on cognitive culture theory and theoretical work on meaning structures in social networks (i.e. a “relationship models”), I use a mixed methods approach (i.e. cultural domain analysis) to examine the cultural domain of trust in a women’s prison. Qualitative inquiry (n = 29) identifies key themes regarding the meaning of the cultural domain. Building from these findings, quantitative measures are created that facilitate the measurement of a “relationship model” trust. Results from the quantitative analysis (n = 198) shows there are multiple relationship models of trust in the unit (i.e. a multicentric cultural domain), women differ in their knowledge of the relationship model, and that this knowledge is related to beliefs relevant to the setting (i.e. cultural consonance).
